# Kiwi: Scientific Acceleration and Logic Synthesis from .net CIL Bytecode

High-Level Synthesis from Concurrent C#.

The KiwiC compiler takes CIL bytecode (dotnet portable assembly PE files) and generates RTL circuits for FPGA (or ASIC). This bytecode is generated by Microsoft .net tools and the mcs C# compiler from the mono project.


# Small, Hardware-oriented Demos
Here are some simple demos from early runs of the KiwiC compiler where illustrative C# programs are compiled to Verilog. All were compiled and run on linux and some have also been run on Windows. These demos explore hardware interfacing.
